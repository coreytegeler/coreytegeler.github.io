At the site’s beginning, visitors are tested by a drag-and-drop sorting game. After placing an item into the correct bin—either paper and cardboard; metal, glass, and plastic; landfill trash; or organics—you’re taken on an animated journey to each step of that item’s life after disposal. You’ll see everything from the familiar, sanitation workers collecting waste in your neighborhood, to the behind-the-scenes magic, the complex sorting systems and surprising new life of properly recycled items.

My civilian collaborators, Haruka Aoki and Jon Packles, and myself volunteered with the official non-profit of NYC’s Department of Sanitation to conceive of and build an educational tool for the organization to display at public events. Through over a year of waste systems research, facility visits, and putting our respective crafts to the job, we created what is now the <em>Follow Your Waste</em> website. The project then expanded to include a set of related lesson plans. Through a partnership with the City’s Department of Education, the website and lesson plans will be distributed for free to teachers to share with the over one-million students enrolled in our public schools.

In collaboration with Ritchin, I designed and developed a digital platform to create and embed interactive photographs that provide critical information and supplementary media about the image and its photographer.

The augmented <em>Four Corners</em> photograph shares information about the photographer and their code of ethics; a written or spoken backstory of what the image captures–from the voice of the photographer or their subject; and additional images, videos, and external links relevant to the primary photograph and its story.

We are currently providing workshops to various schools and organizations on how and why to use the tool and exploring creative and critical uses of the project through online news publication. You can view examples of <em>Four Corners</em> photographs in <a href="https://fourcornersproject.org/en/gallery/" target="_blank">our gallery</a>.</small></details></div></li><li><strong>Mapping the Spirit</strong><div><strong><a href="https://mappingthespirit.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><small>mappingthespirit.com</small></a></strong></div><div class="print-hide"><small>Project by <a href="https://kameelahr.com/" target="_blank">Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a></small></div><div><details><summary><small>More info</small><small>Close</small></summary><small>A digital art object for Kameelah Janan Rasheed’s ongoing project to elaborate on the religious and spiritual articulations of people of African descent in North America. The project uses photography, video, audio, interviews, archival research, and interactivity to tell stories and add depth beyond the reductive narrative of a homogenous “Black church” that is often predominant in our popular media.

The project began with a chapter regarding the Moorish Science Temple of America. Kameelah’s research and documentation focuses on an individual collaborator’s personal spirituality and practices in conjunction with the history and current affairs of their religion and its community. Future chapters will involve additional collaborations with Black religious practitioners and new forms of interactive media.

Throughout the course, students are taught how to conduct archival research practices on a selected collection while also learning critical theory about archives and approaches to decolonize them. Then, after forming groups around shared research topics and digitizing relevant items from the archive, I assist the students in developing projects using the tools and principles of digital humanities scholarship. The students then publish their digital exhibits (interactive essays, maps, data visualizations, timelines, etc.) and supplementary research to a joint project website.

The first two semesters of the course were focused around the papers of an American missionary and founder of Ginling College, the first women’s undergraduate college in China. The website that assembles the research and exhibits over the two semesters taught with this collection is called the <em>Views from Ginling</em>.

The editorialization of this repository aims to problematize the production and distribution of knowledge written about Zimbabwe by highlighting the unbalanced power that Western scholars have over a history and cultural identity far removed from their own. Through a critical lens of the country’s colonial past and authoritarian present, <em>Reading Zimbabwe</em> investigates who writes the country’s history and who has the access to learn it.

The website was developed to be optimized for readers in Zimbabwe on low bandwidth mobile browsers and was designed by Nontsi using visual inspiration from the architecture of Great Zimbabwe and the Khami Ruins.

City’s waste system as well as its crucial importance in the life of our city and its residents. At the site’s beginning, visitors are tested by a drag-and-drop sorting game. After placing an item into the correct bin—either paper and cardboard; metal, glass, and plastic; landfill trash; or organics—you’re taken on an animated journey to each step of that item’s life after disposal. You’ll see everything from the familiar, sanitation workers collecting waste in your neighborhood, to the behind-the-scenes magic, the complex sorting systems and surprising new life of properly recycled items.\n\nMy civilian collaborators, Haruka Aoki and Jon Packles, and myself volunteered with the official non-profit of NYC’s Department of Sanitation to conceive of and build an educational tool for the organization to display at public events. Through over a year of waste systems research, facility visits, and putting our respective crafts to the job, we created what is now the \u003cem\u003eFollow Your Waste\u003c/em\u003e website. The project then expanded to include a set of related lesson plans. Through a partnership with the City’s Department of Education, the website and lesson plans will be distributed for free to teachers to share with the over one-million students enrolled in our public schools.\n\nLearn more about the project:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSanitation Foundation: \u003ca href=\"https://www.sanitationfoundation.org/follow-your-waste\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFollow Your Waste\u003c/a\u003e (page)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNYCxREUSE: \u003ca href=\"https://www.nycxreuse.com/kids-reuse-fair\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProject launch at the donateNYC’s Kids Reuse Fair\u003c/a\u003e (event)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","":"","new":"TRUE"},{"name":"Four Corners Project","url":"https://fourcornersproject.org/","url_nice":"fourcornersproject.org","url_note":"","credits":"Project led by \u003ca href=\"https://www.icp.org/users/fredritchin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFred Ritchin\u003c/a\u003e; project managed by \u003ca href=\"https://www.perrihofmann.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePerri Hofmann\u003c/a\u003e; with assistance from \u003ca href=\"https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/nora-savosnick\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNora Savosnick\u003c/a\u003e","summary_long":"Built on the decades of ideas and practices written, taught, and put into action through innovative multimedia journalism works by Fred Ritchin, the \u003cem\u003eFour Corners Project\u003c/em\u003e is a solutions-oriented approach to provide photojournalists a tool to build essential trust with their audience.
