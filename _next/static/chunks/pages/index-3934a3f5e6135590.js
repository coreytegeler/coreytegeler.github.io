Students learned to conduct archival research at the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary's with assistance from archivists at Union and Barnard. The course was focused around the papers of Matilda Calder Thurston, an American missionary and founder of Ginling College, the first women\u2019s undergraduate college in China.\n\nThe students were divided into three groups, each taking on a major theme found within the material, and through further poring over the archives they developed research their arguments. The shared goal of their collaborative effort was to decolonize the archives by critically analyzing the intent for the collection\u2019s original creation: to exemplify past (and support future) missionary work by western Christians in foreign lands. Their engagement with the collection aimed to recontextualize its content, highlight the missing voices and historical gaps it suffers from, and use the collected information for purposes other than its original colonial intention for compilation.\n\nThroughout the semester, I worked with the students to onboard them into being digital humanities practitioners and determine which interactive tools could strengthen their arguments and properly present their findings publicly. Throughout this collaborative teaching experiment, I built the website, The View from Ginling, using Omeka which allowed students to catalog the digitized documents from the physical collection (and material provided from outside institutions) using Dublin Core metadata standards with assistance from Barnard Library & Academic Information Services (BLAIS) and their Instructional Media and Technology Services (IMATS). Professor Kenny and I repeated the course in the Fall 2019 semester with a new body of students to further the digitization efforts and produce additional interactive exhibits.","":""},{name:"Mapping the Spirit",url:"https://mappingthespirit.com",url_nice:"mappingthespirit.com",url_note:"",credits:'Project by <a href="https://kameelahr.com/" target="_blank">Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a>',summary_long:"This website serves as a digital art object for Kameelah Janan Rasheed\u2019s ongoing archival storytelling project that elaborates on the religious and spiritual articulations of people of African descent in North America.

Largely, his criticism has pointed at how many compounding factors of modern media consumption disregards the context of the images we look at and the credibility of those who produce or share them. Today, these views are far from any form of \u2018prediction,\u2019 but very much part of our media landscape that\u2019s so often plagued by misinformation spread maliciously or otherwise.\n\nFar from cynical, Fred has used his career to conceive and promote strategies that prioritize the ethics and efficacy of photography\u2019s role in society, and always adapting to the time, if not being a bit ahead. One strategy, to enable photographers and publishers to embed necessary information into a photo published on the web, grew to be the Four Corners Project. This increased contextualization strengthens the authorship of the photographer and the credibility of the image by giving viewers access to information about the photographer, their code of ethics, the backstory of what is captured in the image, related images and videos, and external links relevant to the image and its story.\n\nFour Corners images can be generated with a tool on the project\u2019s website and embedded across the web. These interactive embeddable images can be published as standalone photos or in a collection on a photographer\u2019s website, embedded within a journalistic story, or anywhere else images can be published online. Wherever the image exists, it insists to viewers that there is always more context to be understood beyond their immediate understanding of an image and a brief caption.\n\nWe are currently exploring creative and critical usages of the project to empower the authorship of image-makers and the trust of their audience. You can view examples of Four Corners images in our gallery.","":""},{name:"Reading Zimbabwe",url:"https://readingzimbabwe.com/",url_nice:"readingzimbabwe.com",url_note:"",credits:'Project by <a href="http://blackchalkblackchalk.com/" target="_blank">Black Chalk & Co.</a>; research by <a href="http://blackchalkblackchalk.com/images/tinashe-resume.pdf" target="_blank">Tinashe Mushakavanhu</a>; design by <a href="http://nontsikelelomutiti.com/" target="_blank">Nontsikelelo Mutiti</a>',summary_long:"This website houses a growing catalog of over 2,000 published books about Zimbabwe over the past seven decades, spanning across five continents.
