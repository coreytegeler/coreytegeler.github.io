processes, facilities, and workers of New York City’s waste system as well as its crucial importance in the life of our city and its residents. At the site’s beginning, visitors are tested by a drag-and-drop sorting game. After placing an item into the correct bin—either paper and cardboard; metal, glass, and plastic; landfill trash; or organics—you’re taken on an animated journey to each step of that item’s life after disposal. You’ll see everything from the familiar, sanitation workers collecting waste in your neighborhood, to the behind-the-scenes magic, the complex sorting systems and surprising new life of properly recycled items.\n\nMy civilian collaborators, Haruka Aoki and Jon Packles, and myself volunteered with the official non-profit of NYC’s Department of Sanitation to conceive of and build an educational tool for the organization to display at public events. Through over a year of waste systems research, facility visits, and putting our respective crafts to the job, we created what is now the <em>Follow Your Waste</em> website. The project then expanded to include a set of related lesson plans. Through a partnership with the City’s Department of Education, the website and lesson plans will be distributed for free to teachers to share with the over one-million students enrolled in our public schools.\n\nLearn more about the project:\n<ul>\n<li>Sanitation Foundation: <a href=\"https://www.sanitationfoundation.org/follow-your-waste\" target=\"_blank\">Follow Your Waste</a> (page)</li>\n<li>NYCxREUSE: <a href=\"https://www.nycxreuse.com/kids-reuse-fair\" target=\"_blank\">Project launch at the donateNYC’s Kids Reuse Fair</a> (event)</li>\n</ul>","":"","new":true},{"name":"Four Corners Project","url":"https://fourcornersproject.org/","url_nice":"fourcornersproject.org","url_note":"","credits":"Project led by <a href=\"https://www.icp.org/users/fredritchin\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Ritchin</a>; project managed by <a href=\"https://www.perrihofmann.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Perri Hofmann</a>; with assistance from <a href=\"https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/nora-savosnick\" target=\"_blank\">Nora Savosnick</a>","summary_long":"Built on the decades of ideas and practices written, taught, and put into action through innovative multimedia journalism works by Fred Ritchin, the <em>Four Corners Project</em> is a solutions-oriented approach to provide photojournalists a tool to build essential trust with their audience. In collaboration with Ritchin, I designed and developed a digital platform to create and embed interactive photographs that provide critical information and supplementary media about the image and its photographer.\n\nThe augmented <em>Four Corners</em> photograph shares information about the photographer and their code of ethics; a written or spoken backstory of what the image captures–from the voice of the photographer or their subject; and additional images, videos, and external links relevant to the primary photograph and its story.\n\nWe are currently providing workshops to various schools and organizations on how and why to use the tool and exploring creative and critical uses of the project through online news publication.

Kameelah’s research and documentation focuses on an individual collaborator’s personal spirituality and practices in conjunction with the history and current affairs of their religion and its community.

Then, after forming groups around shared research topics and digitizing relevant items from the archive, I assist the students in developing projects using the tools and principles of digital humanities scholarship. The students then publish their digital exhibits (interactive essays, maps, data visualizations, timelines, etc.) and supplementary research to a joint project website.\n\nThe first two semesters of the course were focused around the papers of an American missionary and founder of Ginling College, the first women’s undergraduate college in China.
