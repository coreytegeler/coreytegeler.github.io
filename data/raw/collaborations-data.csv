The View from Ginling,https://mct.barnard.edu/,mct.barnard.edu,,Class taught by Gale Kenny; research by students (full list on the site).,"This digital humanities project was created in collaboration with professor Gale Kenny at Barnard College and the students of her Spring 2018 course titled Religion in the Archives. Students learned to conduct archival research at the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary's with assistance from archivists at Union and Barnard. The course was focused around the papers of Matilda Calder Thurston, an American missionary and founder of Ginling College, the first women’s undergraduate college in China.

The students were divided into three groups, each taking on a major theme found within the material, and through further poring over the archives they developed research their arguments. The shared goal of their collaborative effort was to decolonize the archives by critically analyzing the intent for the collection’s original creation: to exemplify past (and support future) missionary work by western Christians in foreign lands. Their engagement with the collection aimed to recontextualize its content, highlight the missing voices and historical gaps it suffers from, and use the collected information for purposes other than its original colonial intention for compilation.

Throughout the semester, I worked with the students to onboard them into being digital humanities practitioners and determine which interactive tools could strengthen their arguments and properly present their findings publicly. Throughout this collaborative teaching experiment, I built the website, The View from Ginling, using Omeka which allowed students to catalog the digitized documents from the physical collection (and material provided from outside institutions) using Dublin Core metadata standards with assistance from Barnard Library & Academic Information Services (BLAIS) and their Instructional Media and Technology Services (IMATS). Professor Kenny and I repeated the course in the Fall 2019 semester with a new body of students to further the digitization efforts and produce additional interactive exhibits.",,,
Mapping the Spirit,https://mappingthespirit.com,mappingthespirit.com,,"Project by <a href=""https://kameelahr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a>","This website serves as a digital art object for Kameelah Janan Rasheed’s ongoing archival storytelling project that elaborates on the religious and spiritual articulations of people of African descent in North America. The platform uses photography, video, audio, text, and interactivity to tell stories and add depth beyond the reductive narrative of the homogenous “Black church” that often dominates mass media.

The project began with a chapter regarding the Moorish Science Temple of America. Kameelah’s research and documentation focuses on an individual collaborator’s personal spirituality and practices in conjunction with the history and doctrine of their religion and its organizing body. Future chapters will involve additional collaborations with Black religious practitioners and new forms of interactive media.",,,
Four Corners Project,,,,"Project led by Fred Ritchin; project managed by <a href=""https://www.perrihofmann.com/"" target=""_blank"">Perri Hofmann</a>; with assistance from <a href=""https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/nora-savosnick"" target=""_blank"">Nora Savosnick</a>","For decades now, Fred Ritchin has written and taught about the potential and realized troubles that come with the increase of photography being generated, edited, and published digitally. Largely, his criticism has pointed at how many compounding factors of modern media consumption disregards the context of the images we look at and the credibility of those who produce or share them. Today, these views are far from any form of ‘prediction,’ but very much part of our media landscape that’s so often plagued by misinformation spread maliciously or otherwise.

Far from cynical, Fred has used his career to conceive and promote strategies that prioritize the ethics and efficacy of photography’s role in society, and always adapting to the time, if not being a bit ahead. One strategy, to enable photographers and publishers to embed necessary information into a photo published on the web, grew to be the Four Corners Project. This increased contextualization strengthens the authorship of the photographer and the credibility of the image by giving viewers access to information about the photographer, their code of ethics, the backstory of what is captured in the image, related images and videos, and external links relevant to the image and its story.

Four Corners images can be generated with a tool on the project’s website and embedded across the web. These interactive embeddable images can be published as standalone photos or in a collection on a photographer’s website, embedded within a journalistic story, or anywhere else images can be published online. Wherever the image exists, it insists to viewers that there is always more context to be understood beyond their immediate understanding of an image and a brief caption.

We are currently exploring creative and critical usages of the project to empower the authorship of image-makers and the trust of their audience. You can view examples of Four Corners images in our gallery.",,,
Reading Zimbabwe,https://readingzimbabwe.com/,readingzimbabwe.com,,"Project by <a href=""http://blackchalkblackchalk.com/"" target=""_blank"">Black Chalk & Co.</a>; research by <a href=""http://blackchalkblackchalk.com/images/tinashe-resume.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Tinashe Mushakavanhu</a>; design by <a href=""http://nontsikelelomutiti.com/"" target=""_blank"">Nontsikelelo Mutiti</a>","This website houses a growing catalog of over 2,000 published books about Zimbabwe over the past seven decades, spanning across five continents. The editorialization of this repository aims to problematize the production and dissemination of knowledge created about Zimbabwe, highlighting the unbalanced power that Western scholars have over a history and cultural identity far removed from themselves. Through a critical lens of the country’s colonial past and authoritarian present, Reading Zimbabwe investigates who writes the country’s history, and who has the access to learn it.

The website was developed to be optimized for readers in Zimbabwe on low bandwidth mobile browsers and was designed by Nontsi using visual inspiration from the architecture of Great Zimbabwe and the Khami Ruins.",,,
